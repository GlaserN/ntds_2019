    "**Your answer here:** BA network was a good fit in terms of degree distribution but it has a very small clustering coefficient due to its random wirings. Using the clustered power law model, we are able to obtain a graph with a higher clustering coefficient since the graph has a more regular connectivity pattern due to the clusters. Also, it still displays a power-law degree distribution."
